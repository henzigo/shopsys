-   WARNING! This migration can take up to several hours to run, depending on the size of your database. We recommend running it in a staging environment first to estimate the time it will take to run on production. You can run this migration before deploying the new version to production so your project is not locked during deployment and then once again after deployment only for entries created in the meantime.
