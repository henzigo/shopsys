#### registration after order refactoring ([#3462](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3462))

-   FE API: `lastOrderUuid` parameter was removed from `RegistrationDataInput` type, use new `RegisterByOrder` mutation with `RegistrationByOrderInput` to register user after order
-   `CustomerUser::$newsletterSubscription` property was removed to get rid of redundant data in the database, use `NewsletterFacade::isSubscribed()` method instead
    -   check also `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Migrations\Version20241002121943` migration whether it suits your needs
-   [features moved](#movement-of-features-from-project-base-to-packages) from project-base to the frontend-api package:
    -   `RegistrationDataInput` type fields
    -   `NameInputObjectDecorator`
    -   `TelephoneInputObjectDecorator`
    -   `RegisterMutation`
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
