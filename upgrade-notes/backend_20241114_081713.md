-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Elasticsearch\Scope\ProductExportFieldProvider::AVAILABILITY_DISPATCH_TIME` was removed with no replacement
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Form\WarningMessageType` was removed, use `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Form\MessageType` instead
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Product\Availability\ProductAvailabilityFacade::getProductAvailabilityDaysByDomainId()` was renamed to `getProductAvailabilityDaysForFeedsByDomainId()`
