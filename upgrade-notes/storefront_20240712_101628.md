#### Add secure flag to cookies on https ([#3253](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3253))

-   when adding `secure` flag to options of any helper function from `cookies-next`, use `getIsHttps` function to only include the flag for https protocol. Otherwise, the cookie would refuse to be set on unsecure http protocol.
-   when using on server side, make sure to also provide optional `protocol` parameter, which you can get from `getProtocol` helper function. If using `getIsHttps` exclusively on client, there is no need to provide one.
