#### Add banner description UI ([#3574](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3574))

-   the dynamic background color property is build with `getRGBColorString`
    -   splits the hex string into parts representing each color
        -   first two chars representing hexadecimal red
        -   middle two chars representing hexadecimal green
        -   last two chars representing hexadecimal blue
    -   `parseInt` function then converts the two char string in hexadecimals to rgb value (_[16,16] string -> 256 number_)
    -   then it is formatted as `rgb(r g b / a)` css property and set as element's style because tailwind cannot handle dynamic class names
-   the color of the desription text is computed via `getYIQContrastTextColor` to align with the accessibility recommendations (black-ish text for lighter bg and white text for darker bg)
