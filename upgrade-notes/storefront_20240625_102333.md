#### added functionality for notImplementedYet ([#3238](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3238))

-   you can now give a special `notImplementedYetHandler` to things that are currently under development, so that when a user triggers or uses that piece of the application, he is notified (via a toast message) that this piece of functionality is not finished yet
-   you can also use various `NotImplementedYet` elements, which you can find in the `NotImplementedYet.tsx` file
    -   these include various wrappers, tags, and tooltips to mark not implemented things
