#### adjust the GoPay integration to be bound to domains ([#3308](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3308))

-   GoPay is now configured with a single `GOPAY_CONFIG` environment variable
    -   the `GOPAY_CONFIG` environment variable is a JSON object with the following structure:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "goid": "<goid1>",
            "clientId": "<clientId1>",
            "clientSecret": "<clientSecret1>",
            "isProductionMode": false,
            "domains": [1,2]
        },
        {
            "goid": "<goid2>",
            "clientId": "<clientId2>",
            "clientSecret": "<clientSecret2>",
            "isProductionMode": true,
            "domains": [3]
        }
    ]'
    ```
    -   this allows you more flexibility in configuring GoPay for different domains
    -   environment variables `GOPAY_EN_GOID`, `GOPAY_CS_GOID`, `GOPAY_EN_CLIENTID`, `GOPAY_CS_CLIENTID`, `GOPAY_EN_CLIENTSECRET`, `GOPAY_CS_CLIENTSECRET` are no longer used
    -   parameter `%gopay_config%` is no longer used
-   it is recommended to download the GoPay payment method with the cron `GoPayAvailablePaymentsCronModule` and verify all payment methods that are correctly configured
    -   it's no longer necessary to create a separate payment method for each domain due to different GoPay payment method as the form now allows you to select the method for each domain
-   payments and GoPay payment methods are migrated automatically in database migration
    -   see the database migration `Version20240803005343` if you use a different configuration than the default one
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\GoPay\GoPayAvailablePaymentsCronModule::__construct()` changed its interface:
    ```diff
        public function __construct(
    -       protected readonly array $goPayConfig,
            protected readonly GoPayPaymentMethodFacade $paymentMethodFacade,
            protected readonly EntityManagerInterface $em,
            protected readonly Domain $domain,
    ```
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\GoPay\GoPayClientFactory::createByLocale()` was removed, use `createByDomain()` instead
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\GoPay\GoPayClientFactory::getConfigByLocale()` was removed
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\GoPay\GoPayFacade::getGoPayClientByDomainConfig()` was removed, use `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\GoPay\GoPayClientFactory::createByDomain()` instead
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\GoPay\PaymentMethod\GoPayPaymentMethodRepository::getAllIndexedByIdentifierByCurrencyId()` was removed, use `getAllIndexedByIdentifierByDomainId()` instead
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Payment\Payment::$goPayPaymentMethod` is now domain-specific (moved to `PaymentDomain`)
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Payment\Payment::$hiddenByGoPay` is now domain-specific (moved to `PaymentDomain`)
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Payment\PaymentData::$hiddenByGoPay` now contain boolean values for each domain
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Payment\PaymentData::goPayPaymentMethod` was removed, use `$goPayPaymentMethodByDomainId` that contains string values for each domain
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Payment\PaymentFacade::hideByGoPayPaymentMethod()` now requires domain ID as a second parameter
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Payment\PaymentFacade::unHideByGoPayPaymentMethod()` now requires domain ID as a second parameter
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Payment\PaymentRepository::getByGoPayPaymentMethod()` now requires domain ID as a second parameter
