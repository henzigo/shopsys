#### SF optimizations based on projects ([#3222](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3222))

-   settings query now contains URLs of all special articles, so you should
    -   use them from this query and remove the individual implementations
    -   add any other similar URLs which you usually query separately
-   certain homepage server-side-fetched queries were added to redis cache to improve performance
    -   see diff to see which queries are those
    -   validate that you cache queries which would otherwise unnecessarily call the API
-   cypress now considers loader (spinner) when waiting for stable DOM, which helps you to make sure that loaders will not break snapshots
    -   you can try and regenerate your snapshots to see if maybe some of them included loaders by accident
-   storefront is now refreshed when access token could not be refreshed (using refresh token failed)
