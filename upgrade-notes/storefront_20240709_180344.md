#### split transport stores into separate query ([#3251](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3251))

-   instead of getting all stores for each transport, fetching stores was split into separate query
-   after clicking on stores popup, stores are fetched just for a single transport and loading skeleton is displayed
 for better UX
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
