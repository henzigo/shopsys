#### fix product edit in dev environment ([#3544](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3544))

- [features moved](#movement-of-features-from-project-base-to-packages) from project-base to the framework package:
    - product catnum is now required and forced to be unique
- check your code for use of the `FormBuilderInterface::getAttributes()` method and replace it with `FormBuilderInterface::getOptions()['attr'] ?? []` to prevent errors about array-to-string conversion
- see #project-base-diff to update your project
