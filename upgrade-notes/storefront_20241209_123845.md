#### dynamic tab index ([#3644](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3644))

- tab index is now dynamic, so it will be incremented by 1 for each tab, because there can be missing tab in list
- active tab state is needed for animations to work correctly
- see #project-base-diff to update your project
