#### Remove stale original category slug from session ([#3592](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3592))

- sorting is now allowed on different pages than category, but the sort was still trying to recover from SEO category by replacing current url with the original category slug and sort/filter queries
- flags, brands and search pages are out of scope of SEO, therefore the stale `originalCategorySlug` is removed from session store preventing wrong url rewrites
