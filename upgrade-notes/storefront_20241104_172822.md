#### Add animations for mobile navigation menu ([#3569](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3569))

-   refactored menu items UI into `MenuItems` component
-   there are two instances, one with id `animation-visible-element` and one with `animation-hidden-element`
    -   the former is always shown at the end of animation
    -   the latter is always hidden from the view after the animation
    -   we need two instances to show the animation between expanding the menu or going back to parent items
-   at the beginning of a transition, based on the transition function (`handleExpandClick` or `handleBackClick`), we either position the components correctly before the animation, or adjust the position at the end of the animation to make sure we always end up in the default position of components (this is done by `AnimationSequence` and these sequences are named descriptively to ilustrate the resulting transition)
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
