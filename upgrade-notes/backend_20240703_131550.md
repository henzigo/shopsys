#### administration optimization ([#3246](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3246))

-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Component\Paginator\QueryPaginator` class was changed:
    -   `getResult()` method changed its interface:
        ```diff
            public function getResult(
                int $page = 1,
                ?int $pageSize = null,
        +       ?int $totalCount = null,
            ): PaginationResult {
        ```
