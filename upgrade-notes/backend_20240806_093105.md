#### refactoring: OrderStatus::$type is now string ([#3313](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3313))

-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Order\Status\Exception\InvalidOrderStatusTypeException` was removed
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Order\Status\OrderStatus` class was changed:
    -   `TYPE_NEW`, `TYPE_IN_PROGRESS`, `TYPE_DONE`, and `TYPE_CANCELED` constants were removed, use `OrderStatusTypeEnum` constants instead
    -   `$type` property type was changed from `int` to `string`
        -   check `Version20240614144002` migration. If you have any additional order statuses on your project, you need to add a similar migration for them
    -   `setType()` method was removed
        -   the proper type check is now performed in `OrderStatusFactory::create()` method (using `OrderStatusTypeEnum::validateCase()` method)
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Order\Status\OrderStatusFacade` class was changed:
    -   `__construct()` interface was changed:
    ```diff
        public function __construct(
            // ...
    -       protected readonly OrderStatusFactoryInterface $orderStatusFactory,
    +       protected readonly OrderStatusFactory $orderStatusFactory,
    ```
    -   `getAllIndexedById()` method was removed
-   `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Order\Status\OrderStatusFactory` class was changed:

            protected readonly EntityNameResolver $entityNameResolver,
    +       protected readonly OrderStatusTypeEnum $orderStatusTypeEnum,
    ```
    -   `create()` method was changed:
    ```diff
    -   public function create(OrderStatusData $data, int $type): OrderStatus
    +   public function create(OrderStatusData $data, string $type): OrderStatus
