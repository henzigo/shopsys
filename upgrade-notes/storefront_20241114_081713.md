#### Out of stock products behavior ([#3587](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3587))

-   products with stock quantity 0 or less are now considered sellable
-   `<ProductAvailableStoresCount>` component changed:
    -   the component was renamed to `<ProductAvailability>`
    -   it is used on the product detail page as well instead of `<ProductDetailAvailability>` which was removed
    -   property `name: string` was replaced by `availability: TypeAvailability`
    -   property `isMainVariant` was removed, `availableStoresCount` is now nullable (main variant has `null` value)
    -   add new properties `isInquiryType: boolean`, `onClick?: () => void`, and `className: string` (inherited from `FC`) to customize the component
-   rendering of product availability in `<ProductAvailableStoresCount>` and `ProductDetailAvailability>` components is now based on the availability status
-   all the logic related to the cart modifications due to the stock quantity (`cartItemsWithChangedQuantity`, `noLongerAvailableCartItemsDueToQuantity`, `addProductResult.notOnStockQuantity`) was removed
-   "add to cart" spinboxes are no longer restricted by product quantity
