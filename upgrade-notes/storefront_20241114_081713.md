#### Out of stock products behavior ([#3587](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3587))

-   products with stock quantity 0 or less are now considered sellable
-   `<ProductAvailableStoresCount>` component: property `name: string` was replaced by `availability: TypeAvailability`
-   rendering of product availability in `<ProductAvailableStoresCount>` and `ProductDetailAvailability>` components is now based on the availability status
-   all the logic related to the cart modifications due to the stock quantity (`cartItemsWithChangedQuantity`, `noLongerAvailableCartItemsDueToQuantity`, `addProductResult.notOnStockQuantity`) was removed
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
