#### replace hidden root blog category by 1st level one ([#3595](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3595))

-   The hidden 0 level root category has been replaced by 1st level category and is visible now. Also there can be only one main category from now. If you had multiple 1st level categories until now, you will need to update your code to reflect this change and also review `packages/framework/src/Migrations/Version20241112100245.php` migration if it wont fail in your use case.
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
