#### added query/mutation name to URL and headers ([#3041](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3041))

-   queries and mutation names are now part of the request URL, which means query is not made to `/graphql/` but `/graphql/<QueryName>/`
-   if you do not want this, you can skip the changes (ensure there is no `operationNameExchange` used in your URQL client)
-   if you apply this change, it should be easier for you to debug requests in tools like Kibana and also see operation names in browser network tab

#### fix display advert in categories ([#3040](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3040))

#### refactored different levels of error debugging on SF ([#3033](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3033))

-   we now have three levels (`console`, `toast-and-console`, `no-debug`) based on which verbose error messages are shown to developers
-   in your projects, you should use constants `isWithConsoleErrorDebugging`, `isWithToastAndConsoleErrorDebugging`,`isWithErrorDebugging` to control different debugging in all places where you handle errors or exceptions
-   docs were rewritten to match this new approach, so you can read them to get a better idea
-   verbose logging was also added for mutations, so if you need to handle this differently, check `errorExchange.ts`
-   added .env.development for SF, so you should put all your env variables for development there, if you need to handle them in a specific way, differently from the app being in production mode

#### refactor mobile menu ([#3035](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3035))

-   now the whole component is refactored and is included with new design

#### added visitAndWaitForStableDOM for visiting pages in cypress ([#3071](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3071))

-   change all `cy.visit` to `cy.visitAndWaitForStableDOM`, to make sure that cypress waits for the DOM to be stable before interacting

#### cypress with GUI ([#3069](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3069))

-   cypress tests can now be run using cypress interactive GUI
-   read the docs (`cypress.md`) for detailed info

#### SF bundle size reduction changes ([#3077](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3077))

-   we removed `react-dom/server` from the client bundle by removing it from `SeznamMapMarkerLayer`, since we did not use it anywhere else, that was enough for us. If you are using it anywhere else, you should also remove that from the client, as it bloats the bundle
-   URQL is now loaded using dynamic import to load it in a separate chunk, same as other parts of the \_app file, which means you should ideally do it with other large parts of your \_app as well, to separate it into multiple chunks
-   the GQL schema in a JSON format used for teh URQL client is now purified using `@urql/introspection` and the smaller file is used, so keep in mind to change all your imports

```diff
- import schema from 'schema.graphql.json';
+ import schema from 'schema-compressed.graphql.json';
```

-   inside i18n.js, we now report exceptions by sending it to a new Next.js API route `/api/log-exception`, which is done to avoid importing the entire Sentry package on the client, so you should also remove direct imports of Sentry from all the files which are not webpack-compiled, as that has an immense negative effect on performance
-   redis is now blocked from the client bundle by specifying it in the webpack config inside next.config.js, and you should block all other packages which are in your client bundle, but should not be there (check by running `npm run analyze` in the SF folder)

#### GQL generated files split ([#3078](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3078))

-   you should update all the necessary imports of GQL generated files
    -   remove all imports from `/graphql/generated`
    -   instead import from the given `/graphql/requests/**/*.generated.tsx` file or from `/graphql/types.ts`
-   remove all `Api` suffixes from all generated types
    -   or if you want to keep them, do not accept this change to `codegen-config.ts`:

```diff
- typesSuffix: 'Api',
+
```

#### order process fixes ([#3032](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3032))

-   to handle access management on order pages, use the new `useOrderPagesAccess` hook, which handles both loading state and possible redirects
-   there was a bug with manual cache updates for mutations which are deduplicated, to fix this for any other mutations you might have, follow the example added to `graphcache.md`
-   move all your cypress API custom commands to `/cypress/support/api.ts`
-   in cache updates, make sure you do not condition your code on properties, which are sometimes not available
    -   this issue was for example present during transport and payment change for logged in user, where it was caused by the manual cache updates being conditioned on the presence of cart UUID, which is never present for a logged in user
    -   in this case, we caused it by now checking the entire response object (cart nullability)
-   make sure you do not make any actions conditioned on presence of transport/payment during the initial renders, as they are null, because the cart is not loaded yet
    -   this issue was for example present during transport and payment pre-selection based on previous order, where because of asynchronicity of zustand store hydration, when the decision was made to pre-select transport/payment from previous order, transport and payment were always null, thus the transport and payment were always pre-selected, even though the user has already changed his decision
-   check that if you provide multiple identical handlers to any type of inputs (such as multiple `onBlur` or `onChange` as we have in `TextInputControlled`), you correctly combine them into a single handler and call that
    -   you can get insipred in the aforementioned `TextInputControlled`
-   use the newly provided `useOnFinishHydrationDefaultValuesPrefill` if you want to prefill your form with default values which might not be available during the initial load (e.g. because of store hydration)
-   fixed issue with email value update in order third step, where the value was not correctly updated, because the update function used an outdated value of the field. Instead, we now use the event target value, which solves this issue
    -   you should check for similar issues in your code, and make sure that any `onBlur` or `onChange` handlers operate on the newest value
-   contact information page (and form) now loads only after cart is fully loaded, which means you can remove any custom async logic which reacts to cart being loaded and depend on it being there from the beginning
-   `CurrentCustomerUser.ts` was removed and the code moved, as it was used only in a single place, so if you are using it in multiple places, you should keep it
-   radiobutton component now does not accept `onChangeCallback` prop anymore, so you should provide your actions and callbacks via `onClick` if you need to to provide "unchecking" functionality, or `onChange` if you do not
-   select component now accepts ID which is given to the select input and can be used for tests and similar
-   `ContactInformationFormWrapper` was renamed to a better-suited `ContactInformationFormContent`, as it does not wrap the form, but rather contains it
-   `deliveryAddressUuid` is now never null, but we operate with an empty string or an actual UUID, which was done for easier operations with the property, so your application does not need to check for null, but you should check your conditions if they correctly check the empty string value (however, it still has to be mapped to null just before sending to API)
-   removed various useEffects for contact information and rather approached the problem from a synchronous and controlled POV
    -   countries are now loaded during SSR, so we do not have to set the default value using useEffect
    -   we do not set delivery address fields based on `deliveryAddressUuid` using useEffect in the form, but rather just put it in the mutation later, which simplifies the logic
    -   we do the same with pickup place details, which required a more complex validation logic, where we validate delivery address fields based on pickup place, delivery address UUID, and currently logged-in user
    -   what this means for you is that you should ideally also avoid these hacky useEffects, ideally only fill your form with the data you (really) need, and map it later for your mutation
    -   you also now cannot expect the contact information form to contain the information from the delivery address selected by UUID (deliveryAddressUuid) and from the pickup place
-   contact information is now removed from store (and session storage) after logout, so you should either not expect it there, or not accept these changes
-   `useCountriesAsSelectOptions` was added to get mapped countries as select options, which uses `mapCountriesToSelectOptions` internally and thus the function is not exported anymore
    `useCountriesAsSelectOptions` should be used to get countries as select options now
-   removed `useHandleContactInformationNonTextChanges` and instead use `onChange` handlers

#### SF large files split ([#3081](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3081))

-   icons are now in separate files, so update your imports and do the same with any further icons you might have
-   large GTM files were split, so update your imports and do the same to any other GTM files you might have
-   large helper files were split, so update your imports and do the same to any other helper files you might have
-   large hook files were split, so update your imports and do the same to any other hook files you might have
-   `useQueryParams` hook was split into separate files, so update your code and imports
-   `hooks` and `helpers` folders were unified under a new `utils` name, so update your imports and move your files there

#### codegen types and values differentiation ([#3085](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3085))

-   all codegen-generated GQL types now have a `Type` prefix (suffix did not work as expected)
-   you should update all your imports and make sure to apply the new config
-   you should also regenerate your codegen-generated files to make sure your own files apply the new config

#### cypress make command fix ([#3090](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3090))

#### cypress stability fixes ([#3093](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3093))

-   make sure all your links which wait for the `href` to be fetched dynamically use the same styling even before the `href` is available
    -   you can use the newly provided `linkPlaceholderTwClass` as seen below

```diff
components={{
   lnk1: privacyPolicyArticleUrl ? (
       <Link isExternal href={privacyPolicyArticleUrl} target="_blank" />
   ) : (
-       <span />
   ),
}}
components={{
   lnk1: privacyPolicyArticleUrl ? (
       <Link isExternal href={privacyPolicyArticleUrl} target="_blank" />
   ) : (
+       <span className={linkPlaceholderTwClass} />
   ),
}}
```

#### fixed incorrect keys in cache exchange config ([#3094](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3094))

#### Add Developer Styleguide ([#3083](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3083))

During new project implementation phase it is important for a developer who is adjusting new design to be able to see how those changes affect important/base components. This is why we have Styleguide where we have those base components so implementation is faster and developer has better overview of the changes.

#### fixed fix SEO page title, description and heading H1 ([#3108](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3108))

#### SF defer parts of DOM ([#3089](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3089))

-   This PR introduces the possibility of deferring non-critical SF content
-   It also implements it in various places, which you might or might not want to implement as well
-   The best set of steps for you to apply these changes is to read the documentation at `docs/storefront/component-deferring.md` and decide if you want to implement this logic
    -   If you do, then apply it to the already implemented places and use the documentation to pinpoint any other possible places
    -   If you do not, then you can completely omit these changes, as they are not necessary for any future implementation

#### removed duplicated price display on product detail ([#3150](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3150))

#### cookies store smarter init ([#3145](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3145))

#### cypress tests extra scenarios ([#3052](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3052))

-   you should rewrite all `it()` blocks within your test suites from arrow syntax `() => {}` to function syntax `function () {}` as you need to be able to access the `this` keyword
-   `takeSnapshotAndCompare` now accepts the title of the test plus a suffix

```ts
takeSnapshotAndCompare(this.test?.title, 'something to add');
```

-   if the `this.test?.title` is equal to, let's say, `My great test`, this results in the snapshot file being named `My great test (something to add).png`
-   if you use our Docker setup for cypress tests, you should remove setting of the device pixel ratio using `cypress-set-device-pixel-ratio`, as it is not necessary (you can also remove the package)
-   you should not use `waitForStableDOM` in your tests, but rather use `waitForStableAndInteractiveDOM`, as this also checks for skeletons and the NProgress bar
-   `visitAndWaitForStableDOM` was renamed to `visitAndWaitForStableAndInteractiveDOM` and now uses `waitForStableAndInteractiveDOM` internally
-   `reloadAndWaitForStableDOM`was renamed to `reloadAndWaitForStableAndInteractiveDOM` and now uses `waitForStableAndInteractiveDOM` internally
-   you should regenerate your cypress screenshots
-   you should read the updated cypress documentation in our docs in order to understand all the new changes and be able to take advantage of them

#### minor improvements to cypress tests ([#3163](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3163))

-   it is now possible to remove pointer events from elements during cypress screenshots, so you should use this if you have problems with failing screenshots because of different hover/active states
-   as always, read the docs regarding our cypress tests to learn more

#### implement new base design + product page ([#3132](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3132))

We want to implement more usable UI design which will be better base for upcoming projects. These changes are about new design for basic stuff like colors and base elements + design for whole product page.

#### rename variable differentDeliveryAddress into isDeliveryAddressDifferentFromBilling ([#3161](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3161))

-   bool variable differentDeliveryAddress was renamed into more suitable isDeliveryAddressDifferentFromBilling across the project
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project

#### simple navigation images are now blacked-out during cypress tests ([#3174](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3174))

-   simple navgation images are now blacked-out during cypress tests
-   make sure you add the blackout everywhere where your snapshots contain simple navigation with images

#### removed invalid cache invalidation when adding to product list ([#3172](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3172))

#### bump versions of SF packages to fix security issues([#3191](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3191))

#### useContext refactoring ([#3176](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3176))

-   move your contexts as high in the component tree as it makes sense (especially with regards to optimizations), in order to maximally avoid unavailable contexts, but to also not kill the performance of you app with unnecessary rerenders
    -   in our case it meant having all context providers in `_app.tsx`, which means less headaches, but might not be feasible for you
    -   we were only able to do this because we use all our contexts globally, so if you have a local context, do not move it to the root, as that will cause unnecessary rerenders
-   we now throw errors if contexts are used outside of providers, which is good if you want to discover bugs as soon as possible, but might not be the right choice for you
    -   if you can and want provide default state instead of throwing errors, you can do that as well
-   we never use `useContext` directly, but provide a wrapper which takes care of extra actions, such as throwing errors if used outside of a provider

#### minor array keys fix ([#3178](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3178))

#### fixed translation on customer's edit profile page ([#3179](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3179))

#### added option to migrate persist store ([#3171](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3171))

-   persist store can now be migrated (read docs in `store-management.md`)
-   all persist store slices should now expose default state as a constant
-   docs regarding store management (`store-management.md`) were improved, so make sure that you implement changes to store based on them
-   remember to update the `DEFAULT_PERSIST_STORE_STATE` constant in your cypress tests to suit the new version of persist store

#### rename user-consent related code accordingly ([#3181](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3181))

-   route /cookie-consent was renamed to /user-consent
-   components and translations were also renamed/rewritten
-   you should follow this naming convention in your app as well
-   if you have any other special articles (other than t&c, privacy policy, user consent), you should correctly handle their error user codes
-   if you want to use a different approach to non existent special articles (other than the one described in commit messages), be sure to modify the logic, as now
    -   if special articles are not found, error is now not thrown
    -   if t&c and privacy policy articles are not found, the text where they are used are the same, but without the link
    -   if user consent article is not found, we do not display the footer link to the user consent update page, the consent update bar (`UserConsent.tsx`), and the consent update page returns 404
    -   `article-not-found` error user code now displays a better message (not unknown error)

#### fix slider ([#3130](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3130))

On Chrome there was issue when clicking on next/previous button while slider is only partially visible, in this case scroll freeze after scroll onto slider element and is stuck. Fixed by scrolling first onto the slider element and with a little delay continue sliding onto an item in the slider.

#### fix usage of INTERNAL_ENDPOINT env variable ([#3205](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3205))

-   INTERNAL_ENDPOINT env variable is defined with trailing slash, so any usage of it should not include slash at the beginning of the path
-   update your usages in a similar way as in the PR

#### order process refactoring ([#3155](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3155))

-   `useCurrentCart` hook now returns `isCartFetchingOrUnavailable` instead of `isFetching`, which is also based on auth loading and cart not being `undefined`, so you should use this boolean pointer instead
    -   this means you also do not have to check for auth loading and cart being `undefined`, as this is already part of the pointer
-   `isWithCart` is not returned from `useCurrentCart` anymore, as it was only necessary inside the hook
    -   if you need this pointer, you should keep it
-   order actions (back and next) are now both buttons and always accept callbacks/handlers, instead of links
-   `SkeletonManager` now accepts `pageTypeOverride`, which can be used to set the page loading type even for the first render
    -   this is helpful for pagers where we want to display skeletons even for the first load (cart page, order process pages)
    -   with these changes, you can apply `SkeletonManager` anywhere in the app
-   `OrderLayout` now also contains `SkeletonManager`, so you can add a page type for all order process pages
    -   if you have any other layout, you can add `SkeletonManager` there as well
-   contact information page's logic was moved outside from the components (into utils)
-   delivery address UUID is now `new-delivery-address` if the user wants to fill a new delivery address, so you should change any conditions you might have where you check for it being an empty string
-   cypress `goTo` actions should have a check for the URL to which the test navigated, so make sure your `goTo` actions contain it
-   if your tests fill in a delivery address and then check that it is correctly changed, you should use `deliveryAddress2` from the demodata for the second (changed) delivery address in order to better check that everything works as expected
-   you should rename all `fetching`, `isFetching`, `loading`, and `isLoading` variables to more descriptive names, such as `isProductFetching`
-   you should rename all `result`, `response`, and `data` variables to more descriptive names, such as `productDetailData`
-   you should rename all mutation fetching states to names that describe what is happening, e.g. from `isCreateOrderMutationFetching` to `isCreatingOrder`
-   you should rename all your `utils.ts` and `utils.tsx` files to more descriptive names, such as `lastVisitedProductsUtils.ts`

#### Luigi's Box search relations fix ([#3217](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3217))

-   `SearchQuery.graphql` now incldues products search query in order to relate searched categories, brands, and articles to searched products
    -   this is required for Luigi's Box, so if you are not using it for search, then you might skip this change
    -   make sure that `SearchQuery.graphql` includes the same products search query (same fragments, same variables) as `SearchProductsQuery.graphql` in order to utilize URQL cache

#### change free transport limit in demo data ([#3199](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3199))

-   social links in footer were blacked-out for cypress snapshots as they caused issues, so do not forget to add the blackout to snapshots where these links are visible, and also regenerate your screenshots

#### add privacy policy checkbox to contact form ([#3219](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3219))

-   privacy policy checbox is required and needs to be checked in order to submit the contact form
-   the checkbox have replaced the text agreement of the privacy policy by clicking on the submit button

#### restyle orders page ([#3123](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3123))

-   Introduced new CustomerLayout for user section
-   Introduced new user navigation for user section
-   Restyle orders page according to the new design
-   Implement a LinkButton, a link that looks like a button and has props from the Button component, but uses an anchor tag inside

#### implemented registration and login via social networks ([#3154](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3154))

-   implemented are login via Facebook, Google and Seznam
-   actions after login (various cleanups and updates) are now handled in a handler exposed by the `useHandleActionsAfterLogin` hook, so be sure to add all you actions there
    -   if there are specific callback or actions which should only happen if logged-in using social networks/native login, then be sure to mirror that in the aforementioned hook
-   because of the asynchronous logic of auth loading (auth loader messages are dispatched by `<Loaders />` which are loaded dynamically on the client) there was a race conditions which caused auth messages to be displayed only for a very short time, so because of that `<Loaders />` are now loaded during SSR as well
