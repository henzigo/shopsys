#### cypress e2e tests improvement ([#3236](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3236))

-   added blackouts to cypress screenshots of product list item image, product detail main image, product detail variant main image
-   added 2 retries so the test wiil be retried up to 3 times before marking it as failed
-   added z-index to product flags so that they are not hidden by the image blackout
-   added option to specify a `callbackBeforeBlackout`, which can help if you need to perform some action after the scroll, but just before blackout
    -   we have used this for tests where blackout is specified for hovered elements
