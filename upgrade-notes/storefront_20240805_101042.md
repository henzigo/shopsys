#### Fix main navigation skeleton loaders ([#3287](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3287))

-   Show skeleton loaders for main navigation
-   You can choose default skeleton to show by changing `DEFAULT_SKELETON_TYPE` in `DefferedNavigation.tsx` component.
    Note that this skeleton is applied to ALL navigation links in the main navigation
-   `isHrefExternal` function was added to check for external links for which we don't want to trigger skeleton loader
    (this would result into issue with infinite skeleton loader bug)
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
