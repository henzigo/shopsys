#### do not show prices for customer user with role `ROLE_API_CUSTOMER_SEE_PRICES` ([#3319](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3319))

-   added new function `isPriceVisible` which checks if the sent price is `'***'` (API's signal that the prices are hidden)
    -   this function should be used as a condition any time you want to conditionally do something or show something
-   if prices are hidden, GTM events should set all values and prices to `null`
    -   you can use `getGtmPriceBasedOnVisibility` for that, as it either parses the price as float (if visible) or returns null
-   if prices are hidden, GTM ecommerce events should contain a `arePricesHidden: true` boolean pointer
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
