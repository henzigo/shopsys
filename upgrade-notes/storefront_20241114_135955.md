#### split changePersonalDataMutation into two mutations ([#3601](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3601))

- `useChangePersonalDataMutation` now accepts only first/last name, telephone, and newsletterSubscription as input
- use `changeCompanyDataMutation` to change the company data (e.g., billing address, company name, company number, etc.)
- see #project-base-diff to update your project
