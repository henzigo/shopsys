#### add category tree capabilities for articles ([#3237](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3237))

-   all blog pages now use `BlogLayout` which includes the blog article navigation
    -   this means that blog articles now also contain blog navigation
-   blog article page now uses its own skeleton (`SkeletonPageBlogArticle`) instead of sharing one with a simple article page
-   query for blog category detail (more specifically the `BlogCategoryDetailFragment`) does not include blog category tree anymore, but instead the `BlogCategories` is used
    -   this query is now also cached in Redis to not fetch it unnecessarily
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
