#### Add animations ([#3469](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3469))

- add animations to multiple components, unify and improve current animations
- to use animated components, you can choose from predefined animations in `/components/Basic/Animations` or you can create your own (using `AnimatePresence` and motion components from `framer-motion` lib)
- please note that when using `AnimateCollapseDiv`, the padding or margin prop would interfere with the box system resulting in wrong (scattered) animation of the component's height, so set the padding or margin to children or parent component instead
- see #project-base-diff to update your project
