#### SF optimizations based on projects ([#3222](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3222))

-   `Shopsys\FrontendApiBundle\Model\Resolver\Article\ArticleQuery` class was changed:

    -   `termsAndConditionsArticleQuery()` method was renamed to `termsAndConditionsArticleUrlQuery()` and changed its interface:
        ```diff
        -   termsAndConditionsArticleQuery(): array
        +   termsAndConditionsArticleUrlQuery(): string
        ```
    -   `privacyPolicyArticleQuery()` method was renamed to `privacyPolicyArticleUrlQuery()` and changed its interface:
        ```diff
        -   privacyPolicyArticleQuery(): array
        +   privacyPolicyArticleUrlQuery(): string
        ```
    -   `userConsentPolicyArticleQuery()` method was renamed to `userConsentPolicyArticleUrlQuery()` and changed its interface:
        ```diff
        -   userConsentPolicyArticleQuery(): array
        +   userConsentPolicyArticleUrlQuery(): string
        ```

-   queries `termsAndConditionsArticle`, `privacyPolicyArticle`, `userConsentPolicyArticle`were removed
    -   you can use `termsAndConditionsArticleUrl`, `privacyPolicyArticleUrl`, `userConsentPolicyArticleUrl` properties/resolvers on `SettingsQuery` instead
-   functional tests regarding special articles were removed from `GetArticleTest.php` and the newly added functionality is now covered by tests inside `GetSettingsTest.php`
