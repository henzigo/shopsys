#### Storefront color system implementation ([#3311](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3311))

-   `<SimpleNavigation />` now also accepts an icon (e.g. instead of an image)
-   all previous colors were removed from `tailwind.config.js` and instead new, semantically-oriented colors were added
    -   you should use these colors with the focus on their meaning, not the absolute value
    -   it is possible that multiple color variables have the same absolute value (have the same hexcode), but they should be used based on their semantic meaning (link colors for links, action colors for buttons, etc.)
-   many components were simplified in order to have more unified design (see #project-base-diff)
-   some components were completely removed as we do not expect to use them (e.g `FooterBoxInfo`)
-   `<LabelLink />` component was added
    -   it should be used for simple clickable elements (links, divs) that should be easily noticeable in the UI
-   `Cart.tsx` which was used for the cart in header was renamed to `CartInHeader.tsx` (same for `DeferredCart.tsx`)
-   `<Webline />` does not accept a `type` prop anymore, but instead you can modify it using `wrapperClassName`
-   product cards (`<ProductListItem />`) now don't contain spinbox
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
