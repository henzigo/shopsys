#### update yup package to v 1.4 ([#3367](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3367))

##Yup migration from 0.32 to 1.4

Type 'baseSchema' has been changed to 'Schema' - find all occurrences (at least in ValidationRules.ts)

-   `.oneOf(xxx, null, t(‘error’))` - second parameter 'null' is not present anymore. You have to delete it.

-   `Yup.string().when(xxxx` params: is, then, otherwise - all three parameters have to be functions

-   `.then: validateCity(t)` change to `then: () => validateCity(t)`

-   `.otherwise: Yup.String()` change to `otherwise: (schema) => schema`
