#### administrator email now must be unique ([#3686](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3686))

- `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Administrator\Administrator::$email` has now unique constraint
    - check your database for administrator duplicate email addresses and fix them manually
- `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Administrator\Exception\DuplicateUserNameException` was removed, use `UniqueEntityField` constraint for validating administrator unique username instead
- `Shopsys\FrameworkBundle\Model\Administration\AdministratorFacade::checkUsername()` was removed, use `UniqueEntityField` constraint for validating administrator unique username instead
- see #project-base-diff to update your project
