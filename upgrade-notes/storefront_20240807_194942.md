#### fixed issue with invalid ssrExchange initialization ([#3321](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3321))

-   `isRedirectedFromSsr` was renamed to `getIsRedirectedFromSsr` as it more suits the function character
-   you should use a single instance of `ssrExchange` on the client, so make sure you make it a singleton (using `useMemo` as visible in `UrqlWrapper.tsx`)
-   you should call your queries inside `getServerSideProps` the same way both during the first page load and during client-side navigation
    -   this should be done because of
        -   consistency (same behavior during both types of page load)
        -   performance (should be quicker and more optimal to call queries from the server)
    -   for this, you will most likely have to move the condition using `getIsRedirectedFromSsr` lower in order to call the queries, but still not call `handleServerSideErrorResponseForFriendlyUrls` during client-side navigation, because it could cause some problems if the API query/mutation results in an error (this is a known issue)
