#### moved most of the FriendlyUrl functionality from project-base to the framework ([#3320](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3320))

-   99% of functionality has been moved; only functionality connected to ReadyCategorySeoMix is still kept in project-base, until SEO categories are moved to the framework

    +       protected readonly EntityNameResolver $entityNameResolver,
        ) {
    ```
