#### Fix Luigi's box recommended products missing identifiers ([#3671](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3671))

- to fix unhandled error, `logException` is used instead of throwing new Error on missing pathname in `RECOMMENDER_PATHNAMES`
- added more pathname options from where a product may be added to cart, resulting in the `RecommendedProductsQuery` being refetched due to `AddToCartPopup` containing `DeferredRecommendedProducts`
