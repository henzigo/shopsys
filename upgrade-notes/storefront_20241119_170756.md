#### Enable deleting Spinbox's value ([#3607](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3607))

- refactored and simplified `CartListItem` and `Spinbox` with `useDebounce` hook
- user is able to delete the value and write a new one (not enforcing min value on `NaN` value)
- when left blank and input is blurred (unfocused), value is set to the previous one
- internally, the value of `spinboxRef` can become `NaN`, but the `onChangeValueCallback` is only invoked when the value is a number or after input is blurred and is then restored to the previous value
- fixed decreasing value on mouse click
- the `useDebounce` hook in `Spinbox` helps to achieve smoother UX as it waits 500ms before invoking the `onChangeValueCallback`, making it more forgiving for user mistakes
