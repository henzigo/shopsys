#### Switch from Seznam Maps to Google Maps ([#3268](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/3268))

-   The selection of stores is now based on identifier instead of index in mapped stores array
-   `google-map-react` was added to handle the map rendering
-   `use-supercluster` was added to handle the merging of neighbouring stores into clusters
-   For production don't forget to set up the `GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY` in the`.env` file. For development you can leave it blank.
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
-   see also [this commit](https://github.com/shopsys/project-base/commit/0c3cf068e26260cf3186664e9878f6c0e6853e1f) that fixes selecting store by clicking on the map
